[That section](http://github.com/machine-learning-helpers/induction-python/tree/master/installation/jupyter)
explains how to configure [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable),
and in particular how to install new kernels for PySpark, R, Scala and R.
It is part of [the Python induction for Machine Learning (ML) project](http://github.com/machine-learning-helpers/induction-python),
but may be referenced by many other projects.

[The section on Python virtual environments](http://github.com/machine-learning-helpers/induction-python/tree/master/installation/virtual-env)
explains how to install Jupyter Lab within a Python virtual environment.
An alternative way is to use a
[Docker image for Python Jupyter Lab notebooks](http://github.com/machine-learning-helpers/docker-python-jupyter).
