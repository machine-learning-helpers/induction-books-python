## Formulas
$$
P = TP + FN
N = TN + FP
Precision = PPV = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = Sensitivity = TPR = TP / P = TP / (TP + FN)
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (P + N) = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
F1 = 2. (PPV . TPR) / (PPV + TPR) = 2 TP / (2TP + FP + FN)

# Questions & Answers
## Item 1
A supervised learning model has been built to predict whether someone is infected with a new strain of a virus. The probability of any one person having the virus is 1%. Using accuracy as a metric, what would be a good choice for a baseline accuracy score that the new model would want to outperform?

Answer: 0.99 (99%)

## Item 2
Given the following confusion matrix:
|                        | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Condition Positive (P) |        TP = 96     |        FN =  4     |
| Condition Negative (N) |        FP =  8     |        TN = 19     |

Compute the accuracy to three decimal places.

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) = (96 + 19) / (96 + 4 + 8 + 19) = 115 / 127 = 0.906

Answer: 0.906

## Item 3
Given the following confusion matrix:
|                        | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Condition Positive (P) |        TP = 96     |        FN =  4     |
| Condition Negative (N) |        FP =  8     |        TN = 19     |

Compute the precision to three decimal places.

Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 96 / (96 + 8) = 96 / 104 = 0.923

Answer: 0.923

## Item 4
Given the following confusion matrix:
|                        | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Condition Positive (P) |        TP = 96     |        FN =  4     |
| Condition Negative (N) |        FP =  8     |        TN = 19     |

Compute the recall to three decimal places.

Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 96 / (96 + 4) = 96 / 100 = 0.960

Answer: 0.960

## Item 5
Using the fitted model `m` create a precision-recall curve to answer the following question:
For the fitted model `m`, approximately what precision can we expect for a recall of 0.8?

(Use ``y_test`` and ``X_test`` to compute the precision-recall curve. If you wish to view a plot, you can use `plt.show()` )
```python
print(m)
y_scores_m = m.fit(X_train, y_train).decision_function(X_test)
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_scores_m)
plt.figure()
plt.xlim([0.0, 1.01])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.01])
plt.plot(precision, recall, label='Precision-Recall Curve')
plt.xlabel('Precision', fontsize=16)
plt.ylabel('Recall', fontsize=16)
plt.axes().set_aspect('equal')
plt.show()

LogisticRegression(C=1.0, class_weight=None, dual=False, fit_intercept=True,
          intercept_scaling=1, max_iter=100, multi_class='ovr', n_jobs=1,

## Item 13
Using the already defined RBF SVC model `m`, run a grid search on the parameters C and gamma, for values [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]. The grid search should find the model that best optimizes for recall.
