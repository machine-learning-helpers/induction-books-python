# Overview
[This repository](http://github.com/machine-learning-helpers/induction-python)
features a set of various Python Jupyter notebooks, collected from books,
blogs, or originally designed and developed by the
[organization team](http://github.com/orgs/machine-learning-helpers/teams/contributors).
It provides guidance for end-to-end working examples of how to author
Python Jupyter notebooks in just a few minutes.

The source code is properly attributed in the corresponding directories. If you believe some attribution
is missing, please [submit a pull request](http://github.com/machine-learning-helpers/induction-python/pulls)
or [an issue](http://github.com/machine-learning-helpers/induction-python/issues).

That project makes use of [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
and [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html),
which can either be:
* Installed locally on your laptop/workstation. More details are available
  in the corresponding sections of this project:
  + [Python virtual environments](installation/virtual-env)
  + [Jupyter Lab](installation/jupyter)
* Run from/within Docker. More details are available on
  the [Docker images for Python Jupyter Lab notebooks project](http://github.com/machine-learning-helpers/docker-python-jupyter)
